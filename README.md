# Project2-demo

Switch to master branch. Download project and run main.py.
If you do not have a spotify account feel free to use mine when prompted:
user: duskippy-us
pass: firelog4 (I reset my password to this random one for the purposes of testing)

In the other user input field you can enter 'spotify' or any other spotify user (such as my spotify friend 'maxroloff').
